Web Font Specimen - Sinatra Mini App
=====================

[Web Font Specimen](http://webfontspecimen.com/) is a tool built by Tim Brown
([Nice Web Type](http://nicewebtype.com/)) to help web designers make
type-setting decisions. 
It was ported to Compass by [Eric Meyer](http://www.oddbird.net)

And then the styles were taken out of that plugin, and put in to a Sinatra App which doesn't require Compass by [Robert Whitney](http://www.robertjwhitney.com)


Copy your font files into a `fonts` directory in your CSS directory. Fill in your normal, italic and bold
@font-face variables and mixins in `wfs.sass`.
