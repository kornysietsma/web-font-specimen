Web Font Specimen - Sinatra Mini App
=====================

[Web Font Specimen](http://webfontspecimen.com/) is a tool built by Tim Brown
([Nice Web Type](http://nicewebtype.com/)) to help web designers make
type-setting decisions. 
It was ported to Compass by [Eric Meyer](http://www.oddbird.net) And then the styles were taken out of that plugin, and put in to a Sinatra App which doesn't require Compass by [Robert Whitney](http://www.robertjwhitney.com)
... and this fork was made by [Korny Sietsma](http://github.com/kornysietsma) with the following goals:
 - rework with less-css instead of sass
 - auto-detect font directories based on convention rather than configuration
 - user selector for which font to show

*This is a work in progress - don't expect anything to work (yet!)*
